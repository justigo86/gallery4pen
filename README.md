A create-react-app image gallery project that started as a means to implement Firebase Firestore while allowing the user to add/delete items from database.

The project became a little more personalized with the passing of our beloved pup and is now a repository for many of her images. 

Although they have not yet been implemented, potential future additions include mobile-friendly functionality, user login components, user customization options, and categorizing, sorting, and favoriting images.
